Assignment

1) Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
2) The ticker symbol.
3) Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
5) The total stock volume of the stock.
6) Then use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
7) Next, add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
8) Finally, make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet at once.
